# Healthcare Data Analytics with Generative AI in RStudio 

## Welcome
Welcome to this space! I recently began exploring GPT-4o mini and GitHub Copilot to help me speed up my data workflows in R, especially within Healthcare Analytics (see **Health Tech** below). I am excited to share this work to help readers understand the role of RStudio and AI in Healthcare Analytics!

## Quick introduction
This is a space where I will add my current work in **healthcare data analytics**, which will include:
- Publicly available data files used for the analysis done in this space, e.g. dataset_diabetes
- R code snippets for readers to easily view and use for quick data analyses, e.g. cleanDiabetic_data.R
- Quarto and HTML files containing fully developed analytics used in posts, e.g. [**this post**](https://rworks.dev/posts/healthcare-part1/)

## How to use this Repo

**Get to know the diabetes data set from the UCI ML repo**
1. Start with downloading the data from **dataset_diabetes**
2. Read [**this post**](https://rworks.dev/posts/healthcare-part1/) to understand the data in more detail
3. Go to **cleanDiabetic_data.R** and run it in your RStudio to get a leaner, cleaner version of the raw data
4. Click on "Show the code" in the post above OR use **Healthcare_part1.qmd** to explore the data further

## Health Tech

You will also find health tech content in this space, particularly how I leverage Generative AI to further the mission of healthcare technology, with the goal to help decision-makers determine (among other things) the effectiveness of care delivery and treatments, ensuring that the right care reaches the right patient at the right time.

You will find images, R code snippets, PDF's and other tools that will enable you to learn more about how tidyverse with the augmentation of the use of pair programmers like Copilot and Ellmer, can be an immensely powerful mechanism for healthcare technology.
