# HTA
## Introduction
This is a space where I will add my health technology analysis (HTA) work, which will include:
- R code snippets for readers to easily view and use
- Quarto and HTML files containing fully developed analytics used in posts for [rworks.dev](https://rworks.dev/)
- Publicly available data files used for the work above

## Files
1. dataset_diabetes -- the original diabetes dataset from UCI ML repo
2. cleanDiabetes_data -- an R code snippet that will clean the raw data, reducing its size, pre-processing and creating fields to use in our analytics
