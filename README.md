# Healthcare Data Analytics with Generative AI in RStudio 

## Welcome
Welcome to this space! I recently began exploring GPT-4o mini and GitHub Copilot to help me speed up my data workflows in R, especially within Healthcare Analytics. I am excited to share this work to help readers understand the role of RStudio and AI in Healthcare Analytics!

## Quick introduction
This is a space where I will add my current work in **healthcare data analytics**, which will include:
- Publicly available data files used for the analysis done in this space, e.g. dataset_diabetes
- R code snippets for readers to easily view and use for quick data analyses, e.g. cleanDiabetic_data.R
- Quarto and HTML files containing fully developed analytics used in posts, e.g. [**this post**](https://rworks.dev/posts/healthcare-part1/)
*Note:* **more_RStudio** contains other non-healthcare work in RStudio!

## How to use this Repo

**Get to know the diabetes data set from the UCI ML repo**
1. Start with downloading the data from **dataset_diabetes**
2. Read [**this post**](https://rworks.dev/posts/healthcare-part1/) to understand the data in more detail
3. Go to **cleanDiabetic_data.R** and run it in your RStudio to get a leaner, cleaner version of the raw data
4. Click on "Show the code" in the post above OR use **Healthcare_part1.qmd** to explore the data further
